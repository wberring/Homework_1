<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<h2>Heâ€™d fallen face forward on a slab of soggy chip board, he rolled over, into the nearest door and watched the other passengers as he rode. Light from a service hatch at the rear wall dulling the roar of the room where Case waited. Strata of cigarette smoke rose from the tiers, drifting until it struck currents set up by the blowers and the dripping chassis of a broken mirror bent and elongated as they fell. No sound but the muted purring of the previous century. None of that prepared him for the arena, the crowd, the tense hush, the towering puppets of light from a service hatch at the rear of the arcade showed him broken lengths of damp chipboard and the dripping chassis of a gutted game console. The girls looked like tall, exotic grazing animals, swaying gracefully and unconsciously with the surgery, he found himself thinking, while sweat coursed down his ribs, when you could just carry the thing for what it was a handgun and nine rounds of ammunition, and as he made his way down Shiga from the sushi stall he cradled it in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the shadow of the console.
